# SQL Data Analytics Project

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts focused on **exploratory analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs), and business insights** using warehouse-ready data from a data warehouse (Gold layer).

All queries are designed to demonstrate practical analytics techniques using SQL Server, including trend analysis, segmentation, performance comparison, customer behavior, and advanced patterns like RFM and cohort analysis.
